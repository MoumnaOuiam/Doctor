        <p class="MyTitle" data-aos="fade-right">Who will respond to my request?</p>
        <p>Depending on your issue, a general practitioner or a specialist doctor will review your case, your symptoms, and then initiate a teleconsultation with you in order to propose a treatment, additional tests to be conducted, or prescriptions and treatments for a specialized consultation.</p>
        <p class="MyTitle" data-aos="fade-left">How long will the exchange last?</p>
        <p>At the time of the teleconsultation, the doctor will already have knowledge of your medical history, treatments, and your problem, which speeds up the process of care.
        An interaction occurs systematically between the doctor and the patient remotely, either through the secure instant messaging of Expatica or through video conferencing, based on the duration deemed necessary, just like in a traditional medical office.</p>
